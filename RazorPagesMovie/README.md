### Homework 4: Razor Pages Movie App
### URL OF SITE: not currently hosted, functionality is exact copy of https://rpowellmvc.azurewebsites.net/Movies

### Description
This app is the result of follwing the Razor pages tutorials at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/razor-pages/?view=aspnetcore-2.1 and https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/razor-pages/upload-files?view=aspnetcore-2.1
The movie app tracks a list of movies along with information about them. Each movie entry is stored in a database and has a separate razor page to view details, edit, create, and delete.
The app is organized into Models and Pages. Each page is comprised of a razor .cshtml file and a corresponding .cshtml.cs file.
Models are used to create classes of data and connect to the database. I created a model class for Movies, Movie Genres, and Seed Data. This is exactly the same as in an MVC architecture.
Where the razor pages methodology differs from MVC is in the views and controllers.
