### Description
This app is the result of follwing the MVC App tutorial at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app/?view=aspnetcore-2.1 
The movie app tracks a list of movies along with information about them. Each movie entry is stored in a database and has a separate view to view details, edit, create, and delete.
The app is organized into models, views, and controllers. 
Models are used to create classes of data and connect to the database. I created a model class for Movies, Movie Genres, and Seed Data.
Views provide the user interface for the site. They are separated into folders connected to controllers.
A controller was created for movies. This controller handles routing and has a function for each view related to the movie section of the site.
